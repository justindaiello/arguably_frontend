Ever get into a a ridiculous argument with a friend or loved one and wish you could easily check with other people to prove you are right?

Arguably enables users to crowdsource their subjective debates. Simply add the subject, a few supporting points on both sides of the debate, and a poll is created to be voted on by friends and the whole interweb!

We decided to keep the app's functionality and UI simple as the app is designed for quick use (probably often at a bar).

For further development, a login and sign up will be necessary so that polls cannot be deleted by anyone visiting the site, only the creator of the poll.
